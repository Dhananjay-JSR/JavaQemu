This repo is for recording code changes for JavaQemu software.

Mirroring information about JavaQemu:

JavaQemu is a Graphical User Interface Front End for QEMU, written in Java.
JavaQemu works with JRE 1.7/1.8 and MS Windows OS.
Since version 0.0.4a15, JavaQemu works with JRE 1.6 or Linux OS/Mac OS, too.
Since version 0.2.0a10, JavaQemu works only with JRE 1.7+.

This project was canceled because I am focusing again on the Python programming language.
